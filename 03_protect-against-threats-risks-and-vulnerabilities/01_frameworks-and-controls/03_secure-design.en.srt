00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,760
Hi, welcome back!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,980
Previously, we
discussed frameworks

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,375
and controls in general.

4
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,010
In this video,
you'll learn about

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,040
specific frameworks and
controls that organizations

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,290
can voluntarily use to minimize

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,125
risks to their data
and to protect users.

8
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,085
Let's get started!

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,780
The CIA triad is a foundational model

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,390
that helps inform how
organizations consider

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,840
risk when setting up systems
and security policies.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,050
CIA stands for confidentiality,

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,645
integrity, and availability.

14
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:37,320
Confidentiality means that
only authorized users

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,260
can access specific
assets or data.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,760
For example, strict
access controls that

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,630
define who should and should
not have access to data,

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,370
must be put in place to ensure

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,940
confidential data remains safe.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,290
Integrity means the data is

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,100
correct, authentic,
and reliable.

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,880
To maintain integrity,

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,310
security professionals
can use a form of

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,125
data protection like encryption

25
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,585
to safeguard data from
being tampered with.

26
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:08,120
Availability means data is

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,015
accessible to those who are
authorized to access it.

28
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,670
As an example, a
director may have

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,730
more access to certain data
than a department manager

30
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,984
because directors usually
oversee more employees.

31
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:22,010
Let's define a term
that came up during

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,110
our discussion of the CIA triad:

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,500
asset.

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,840
An asset is an item perceived as having
value to an organization.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,870
And value is determined by the cost

36
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,225
associated with the
asset in question.

37
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:37,960
For example, an application
that stores sensitive data,

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,080
such as social security
numbers or bank accounts,

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,615
is a valuable asset
to an organization.

40
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,344
It carries more risk
and therefore requires

41
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,865
tighter security
controls in comparison

42
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:52,030
to a website that shares
publicly available news content.

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,620
As you may remember,

44
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,700
earlier in the course,

45
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,520
we discussed frameworks
and controls in general.

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,730
Now, we'll discuss a specific
framework developed by

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,200
the U.S.-based National

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,595
Institute of Standards
and Technology:

49
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,890
the Cybersecurity
Framework, also

50
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,625
referred to as the NIST CSF.

51
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,110
The NIST Cybersecurity
Framework is

52
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,005
a voluntary framework that
consists of standards,

53
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,120
guidelines, and best practices

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,175
to manage cybersecurity risk.

55
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,890
It's important to become
familiar with this framework

56
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,720
because security teams use it as

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,145
a baseline to manage
short and long-term risk.

58
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:29,720
Managing and mitigating
risks and protecting

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,280
an organization's assets from

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,570
threat actors are key goals
for security professionals.

61
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,395
Understanding the
different motives

62
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:38,000
a threat actor may have,

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,310
alongside identifying
your organization's

64
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,790
most valuable assets
is important.

65
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,170
Some of the most
dangerous threat actors

66
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,495
to consider are
disgruntled employees.

67
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:50,270
They are the most dangerous
because they often have

68
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,054
access to sensitive information

69
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:53,860
and know where to find it.

70
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,480
In order to reduce
this type of risk,

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,310
security professionals would use

72
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,960
the principle of availability,

73
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,150
as well as organizational
guidelines

74
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,950
based on frameworks to ensure

75
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,840
staff members can only access

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,435
the data they need to
perform their jobs.

77
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:11,780
Threat actors originate
from all across the globe,

78
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,420
and a diverse workforce
of security professionals

79
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,975
helps organizations identify
attackers' intentions.

80
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,515
A variety of perspectives
can assist organizations in

81
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,090
understanding and mitigating

82
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,415
the impact of
malicious activity.

83
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,560
That concludes our
introduction to

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,115
the CIA triad and
NIST CSF framework,

85
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:33,080
which are used to
develop processes to

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,020
secure organizations and
the people they serve.

87
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,450
You may be asked in
an interview if you

88
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,970
know about security
frameworks and principles.

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,220
Or you may be asked to
explain how they're

90
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,315
used to secure
organizational assets.

91
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,935
In either case,
throughout this program,

92
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,660
you'll have multiple
opportunities

93
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,950
to learn more about them

94
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,295
and apply what we've discussed
to real-world situations.

95
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,320
Coming up, we'll discuss

96
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,270
the ethics of security.
See you soon!
