Hi, I'm Veronica and I'm a
security engineer at Google. My journey into
cybersecurity has changed my life for the
better in so many ways. The most important part
is fulfilling work. I get to do something
that I absolutely love and that I'm
super interested in, and I feel very lucky that this is what I
get to do for work. Before I entered
my current field, I had no idea what
cybersecurity was. My knowledge of cybersecurity was using secure passwords, and that was about it. So if you asked me, you know, would I be in cybersecurity five years ago? I would've said, what is that? Someone without a
technical background can 100% be
successful in cybersecurity. My path to my current
role in cybersecurity started as an IT resident here at Google
staff in Techstop. I learned a lot of
analytical thinking skills, working on a help desk,
troubleshooting, debugging. I didn't realize I had
transferable skills until I got into my
role in cybersecurity. And from there, I took
it upon myself to bug a bunch of
security engineers, interviewed a lot of them. I didn't get here alone. It took a village of
mentors to get me here, so don't be afraid
to ask for help. I don't think someone needs a college degree to go
into cybersecurity. Some of the brightest minds that I get to work with
don't have a college degree, so I think that's one
of the best parts about the industry. Looking back at my career, I wish I would have known that I don't have
to check all the boxes, that I don't have
to be an expert in the area to shoot my shot, and I also wish I
would've known that perfectionism can get in the way of what you want to achieve.
