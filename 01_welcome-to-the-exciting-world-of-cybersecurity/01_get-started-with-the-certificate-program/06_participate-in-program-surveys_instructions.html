  Entry survey
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  First, you will have an opportunity to answer a brief survey to help researchers understand why you enrolled in this certificate program. If you don’t fill out the survey now, you will receive an invitation to fill it out after completing your first video or activity.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  The survey asks about your experiences leading up to this program and the goals you hope to achieve. This is critical information to ensure your needs as a learner are met and that this program will continue to be offered in the future.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Individual course feedback
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you complete the last graded assignment within an individual course, you might be asked to complete a survey. This survey will revisit questions from the previous survey and ask what you have learned up to that point in the program. Again, filling out this information is voluntary but extremely beneficial to the program and future learners.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Certificate completion survey
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you complete the last graded assignment in the final (eighth) course of the certificate program, you will be asked to complete a survey that revisits some earlier questions and asks what you have learned throughout the duration of the program. This survey also asks whether you would like to share your contact information with prospective employers. Filling out the survey and sharing your contact information with prospective employers is completely optional and will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job offer in any way.
