  Here is a list of best practices that will help you complete the courses in the program in a timely manner:

 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    <strong>
     Plan your time:
    </strong>
    Setting regular study times and following them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to set achievable goals. Find a space that allows you to focus when you watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities.

    <strong>
     Work at your own pace:
    </strong>
    Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, feel free to move through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. You can extend your deadlines at any time by going to
    <strong>
     Overview
    </strong>
    in the navigation panel and selecting
    <strong>
     Switch Sessions
    </strong>
    . If you have already missed previous deadlines, select
    <strong>
     Reset my deadlines
    </strong>
    instead.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    <strong>
     Be curious:
    </strong>
    If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The steps you take to support your learning along the way will advance your knowledge, create more opportunities in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    <strong>
     Take notes:
    </strong>
    Notes will help you remember important information in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Review exemplars:
    </strong>
    Exemplars are completed assignments that fully meet an activity's criteria. Many activities in this program have exemplars for you to validate your work or check for errors. Although there are often many ways to complete an assignment, exemplars offer guidance and inspiration about how to complete the activity.
