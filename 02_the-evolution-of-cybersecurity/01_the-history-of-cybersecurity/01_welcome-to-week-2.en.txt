Welcome back! When it
comes to security, there is so much
to learn, and I'm thrilled to be part of
your career journey. This is such an exciting time to be learning about security! When I learned about
international hacks that impacted both private companies and government organizations, I was inspired to want to
work in security because I realized how dynamic and
important this field is. One reason there are so many jobs in the
security field today, is because of attacks
that happened in the 1980s and 1990s. Decades later,
security professionals are still actively working to protect organizations and people from variations of these
early computer attacks. In this section of the course, we'll discuss viruses and malware, and introduce the
concept of social engineering. Then, we'll discuss how the digital age ushered in
a new era of threat actors. Knowing the evolution
of each attack is key to protecting
against future attacks. Lastly, we'll provide an overview of eight
security domains. Next up, we'll
travel back in time, to explore some of the viruses, data breaches, and
malware attacks that have helped shape the
industry as we know it today.
