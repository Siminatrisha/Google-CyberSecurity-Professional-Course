1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,260
The security industry
is constantly evolving,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,560
but many present-day attacks
are not entirely new.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,745
Attackers often alter or
enhance previous methods.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,040
Understanding past attacks can

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,170
provide direction
for how to handle

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,000
or investigate incidents in

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,430
your job as a security analyst.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,535
First, let's go over
a couple of key terms

9
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,425
that will support
your understanding

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,375
of the attacks we'll discuss.

11
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,040
A computer virus is

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,410
malicious code written
to interfere with

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,420
computer operations and cause

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,970
damage to data and software.

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,300
The virus attaches itself to

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,570
programs or documents
on a computer,

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,640
then spreads and infects

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,580
one or more computers
in a network.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,550
A worm is a type of
computer virus that can

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,170
duplicate and spread on its

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,500
own without human involvement.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,025
Today, viruses are more commonly
referred to as malware,

23
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,224
which is software designed
to harm devices or networks.

24
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:05,150
Two examples of early
malware attacks that we'll

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,600
cover are the Brain virus
and the Morris worm.

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,160
They were created by

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,430
malware developers to
accomplish specific tasks.

28
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,209
However, the developers
underestimated the impact

29
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:19,250
their malware would
have and the amount

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,760
of infected computers
there would be.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,560
Let's take a closer look
at these attacks and

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,880
discuss how they helped shape

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,150
security as we know it today.

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,510
In 1986, the Alvi brothers
created the Brain virus,

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,225
although the intention of
the virus was to track

36
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:37,580
illegal copies of
medical software

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,815
and prevent pirated licenses,

38
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:42,850
what the virus actually
did was unexpected.

39
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,340
Once a person used a pirated
copy of the software,

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,605
the virus-infected
that computer.

41
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:51,080
Then, any disk that was

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,205
inserted into the computer
was also infected.

43
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,014
The virus spread
to a new computer

44
00:01:57,014 --> 00:02:00,710
every time someone used
one of the infected disks.

45
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,870
Undetected, the virus

46
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,590
spread globally within
a couple of months.

47
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,580
Although the
intention was not to

48
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,920
destroy data or hardware,

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,530
the virus slowed down
productivity and

50
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,865
significantly impacted
business operations.

51
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:18,170
The Brain virus fundamentally

52
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,045
altered the computing industry,

53
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,310
emphasizing the
need for a plan to

54
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,435
maintain security
and productivity.

55
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,455
As a security analyst,

56
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:29,150
you will follow and maintain

57
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,220
strategies put in
place to ensure

58
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,335
your organization has a plan

59
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,215
to keep their data
and people safe.

60
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,970
Another influential computer
attack was the Morris worm.

61
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,740
In 1988, Robert Morris developed

62
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,740
a program to assess the
size of the internet.

63
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,475
The program crawled the web
and installed itself onto

64
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,470
other computers to
tally the number

65
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,115
of computers that were
connected to the internet.

66
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:56,085
Sounds simple, right?

67
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,040
The program, however, failed to

68
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,185
keep track of the
computers and had

69
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:03,350
already compromised and
continued to re-install

70
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,520
itself until the computers ran
out of memory and crashed.

71
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,370
About 6,000 computers
were affected,

72
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,415
representing 10% of the
internet at the time.

73
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:17,300
This attack cost millions of
dollars in damages due to

74
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,340
business disruptions
and the efforts

75
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,320
required to remove the worm.

76
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,925
After the Morris worm,

77
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,505
Computer Emergency
Response Teams,

78
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,530
known as CERTsÂ®, were

79
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,715
established to respond to
computer security incidents.

80
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:33,140
CERTs still exist today,

81
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,300
but their place in the
security industry has

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,345
expanded to include
more responsibilities.

83
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,190
Later in this program,

84
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,660
you'll learn more about

85
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,300
the core functions of
these security teams

86
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,370
and gain hands-on practice

87
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,775
with detection and
response tools.

88
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,230
Early attacks played a key role

89
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,420
in shaping the current
security industry.

90
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,460
And coming up, we'll discuss how

91
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,440
attacks evolved in
the digital age.
