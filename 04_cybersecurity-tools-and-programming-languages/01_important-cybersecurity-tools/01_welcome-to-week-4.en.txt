Welcome to the final
section of this course! Here, we'll be
introducing tools and programming languages that are commonly used in
the security field. They are essential for
monitoring security in an organization
because they enhance efficiency by automating tasks. Although we're only introducing these concepts and
tools at this point, later in the program, you'll have opportunities
to use them in a variety of
hands-on activities. In the following videos, you'll learn about
security information and event management, or SIEM, tools. You'll also be introduced
to other tools such as playbooks and network
protocol analyzers. Then, you'll learn about the
Linux operating system and security-related tasks
that are initiated through programming languages,
such as SQL and Python. For me, SQL is one of
the most useful tools. It allows me to explore all the different data
sources we collect, and it allows my team to
analyze the data for trends. Take your time going
through the videos and if you need
to, re-watch them. Also know that
these tools will be discussed in much more detail, and you will be able
to practice them firsthand, later in the
certificate program. While every organization has
their own set of tools and training materials that you'll
learn to use on the job, this program will provide you with foundational
knowledge that will help you succeed in
the security industry. Let's get started!
