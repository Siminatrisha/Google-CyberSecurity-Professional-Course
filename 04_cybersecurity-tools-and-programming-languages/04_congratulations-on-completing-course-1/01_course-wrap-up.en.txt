Congratulations on
completing the first course! We've come so far and covered so much about a really
exciting industry. I find cybersecurity to be
exciting because it's dynamic. There are always new
puzzles to solve, and the work of protecting
our users is worthwhile. Before we move on,
let's take a moment to celebrate and reflect
on what we've covered. First, we introduced
core security concepts, including what security
is and why it matters. We also discussed what an entry-level security analyst does and some skills
related to the role. Then, we transitioned to
eight security domains, which include security
and risk management, asset security, and
security operations. Next, we highlighted security
frameworks and controls. Specifically, the CIA triad model and the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework. Finally, we explored
common tools and programming languages used by security analysts, such as SIEMs, playbooks, SQL, and Python. I hope you're proud of the
work you've done so far. No matter what direction you take in the
security industry, everything you've learned lays the foundation for the
next phase of your career. And, as you move through
this program, you'll have the chance to
develop your skills further. In the next course, we'll
provide more details about several of the topics
introduced in this course. Hi, I'm Ashley, and I
will be guiding you through the next course of
this certificate program. We'll discuss
security domains and business operations
in greater detail. I'm so glad I was able to be here for the beginning
of your journey. You're off to a great start. I'm excited for you to reach your goal of joining
the security industry!
